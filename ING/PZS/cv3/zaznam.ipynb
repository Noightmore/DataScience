    "# **Direction of Arrival (DOA) Using Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "The **Direction of Arrival (DOA)** is the angle from which a sound source is coming relative to an array of microphones. By measuring the **Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)** between two microphones, we can calculate this angle using the known **speed of sound** and the **distance between the microphones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is commonly used in:\n",
    "- **Acoustic localization systems** (e.g., smart speakers, surveillance systems).\n",
    "- **Beamforming** in microphone arrays to enhance sound from a specific direction.\n",
    "- **Robotics and drones** for sound source tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conceptual Flow**\n",
    "1. **Cross-Correlation**: Calculate the cross-correlation between the two microphone signals to find the time lag corresponding to the maximum similarity.\n",
    "2. **Finding the Lag**: Identify the lag (time shift) at which the cross-correlation is maximum. This lag corresponds to the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the sound wave between the two microphones.\n",
    "3. **Calculating TDOA**:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "TDOA = \\frac{\\text{Lag}}{\\text{Sampling Rate}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. **Direction of Arrival (DOA)**:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "DOA = \\arcsin\\left( \\frac{TDOA \\cdot c}{d} \\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( c \\) = Speed of sound in air (~343 m/s at 20°C)\n",
    "- \\( d \\) = Distance between microphones\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Convert to Degrees**:\n",
    "```math\n",
    "DOA_{deg} = DOA \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Cross-Correlation**\n",
    "Cross-correlation is used to measure the similarity between two signals as a function of the time-lag applied to one of them. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "r_{xy}[\\tau] = \\sum_{n} x[n] \\cdot y[n+\\tau]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are the signals from the two microphones.\n",
    "- \\( \\tau \\) is the lag applied to one signal relative to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Finding the Maximum Correlation**\n",
    "To find the TDOA, we look for the maximum value in the cross-correlation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mx_ind = np.argmax(r_xy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `mx_ind` represents the index at which the cross-correlation is the highest, indicating the lag at which the signals are most similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding lag is then adjusted by the length of the original signal:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mx_ind = mx_ind - x_L + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)**\n",
    "The TDOA is calculated by converting the lag into time:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "TDOA = mx_ind / fs\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `mx_ind` = Maximum correlation index (lag)\n",
    "- `fs` = Sampling rate of the audio\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Calculating Direction of Arrival (DOA)**\n",
    "Using the TDOA, the DOA can be calculated as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "DOA_rad = np.arcsin(TDOA * c / d)\n",
    "DOA_deg = np.degrees(DOA_rad)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( \\arcsin \\) is used because we are calculating the inverse sine of the ratio.\n",
    "- The ratio represents the sine of the angle of arrival.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Visualization and Interpretation**\n",
    "The **cross-correlation plot** shows the similarity between the two signals as a function of lag. The peak indicates the point of maximum similarity, corresponding to the TDOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DOA angle** is calculated in both **radians** and **degrees**. This angle indicates the direction from which the sound is coming relative to the microphone pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Applications and Use Cases**\n",
    "- **Audio beamforming**: Focusing on sounds coming from a specific direction.\n",
    "- **Sound source localization**: Determining the position of a sound source.\n",
    "- **Speech enhancement**: Isolating speech from a particular direction in noisy environments.\n",
    "- **Robotics and drones**: Directional hearing for navigation or source tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Possible Enhancements**\n",
    "- **Noise filtering**: Pre-process the audio to improve cross-correlation accuracy.\n",
    "- **Multi-microphone arrays**: For 2D or 3D localization.\n",
    "- **Beamforming**: Combining multiple DOAs for more accurate sound source localization.\n",
    "- **Dynamic environments**: Adapting the speed of sound based on environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "This implementation uses **cross-correlation** and **TDOA** to estimate the **DOA** of a sound source with a two-microphone setup. It leverages the relationship between time delays and the angle of arrival, providing a robust method for **acoustic source localization**.\n",
